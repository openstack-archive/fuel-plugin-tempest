features:
  - Add the ability to skip the mysql user and/or grant creation as part of the
    openstack::db::mysql resource.
fixes:
  - openstack::db::mysql could not be used to create multiple databases
    with the same user/password for access due to a duplicate mysql_user
    resource declaration. Now the user and/or grant creation process can be
    skipped if they already exist.
