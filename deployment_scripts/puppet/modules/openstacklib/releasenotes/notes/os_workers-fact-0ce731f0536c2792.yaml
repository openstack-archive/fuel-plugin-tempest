features:
  - Moved existing $::os_workers to $::os_workers_small
  - Updated $::os_workers to have a value between '2' and '12'.
    The value of this fact is the larger value between '2'
    and the number of processors divided by '2' but will not
    exceed '12'.
  - Created fact $::os_workers_large to have a value of number
    of processors divided by '2'
fixes:
  - bug 1650424 The current calculation for os_workers negatively
    impacts api response times
