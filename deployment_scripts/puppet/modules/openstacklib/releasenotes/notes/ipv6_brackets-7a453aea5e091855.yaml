  - Utility to handle IPv6 address brackets with normalize_ip_for_uri
    is a function that help us to add brackets to IPv6 addresses
    when missing. The function moved to puppetlabs-stdlib but is not in latest release
    yet. Once it's done, we'll probably drop this function so our modules will use stdlib.
