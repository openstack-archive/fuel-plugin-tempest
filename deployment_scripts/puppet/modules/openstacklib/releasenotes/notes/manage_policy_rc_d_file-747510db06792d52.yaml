features:
  - Add a class that takes an array of services that can be
    configured to not autostart on package install. The most
    notable example is keystone. The policy-rc.d file is
    generated to return the correct exit code to prevent the
    services from autostarting on package install. This change
    is only meant for debian based systems.
issues:
  - ubuntu cloud archive keystone package is auto-starting the
    eventlet process on package install.
