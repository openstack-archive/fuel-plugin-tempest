fixes:
  - Add retries to the openstack command.
    Increase command timeout to 20s and request timeout to 60s
    and sleep 3s between retries. Do not retry non-idempotent actions.
    This is a more robust implementation that will prevent failures in case
    of Keystone API failures during a deployment.
